TODO:

* Utils/MathUtils, Plots?, nn creation, etc
    * use mathUtils for imgGen,imgevo, etc
* tools for plots output(white image, 2 big lines for x and y, labels, datapoints, lines)
* reshape of data 2d -> 1d | one shot encoding?
-
* reimplement feedforward - back-propagation - train - impl(neuro * conn)
* Fix Activations and derivatives
* Check training from NeuralNetwork and fix back-propagation and gradient descend
    * divide functions run and train into multiple little functions that do a simple work
    * make an EvoAI::feedforward and EvoAI::train that works with matrices of neurons
* make unit tests
