# EvoAI #

TODO:

* Fix Activations and derivatives
    * add tests for activations
* Check training for NeuralNetwork and fix back-propagation and gradient descend
    * divide functions run and train into multiple little functions that do a simple job
    * make an EvoAI::feedforward and EvoAI::train that works with matrices of neurons
